Next two releases:
use bitmasks where possible, add these to init list for part_types
splitting of powder.c
feature freeze
Focus on scalability
stability, possibly not use -O3 on linux, inlines where possible.
performance.
Multithreading?

Murtaughs roadmap:
Mur's V1.0-V1.2:
Added these elements:
	BASE - Neutralizes ACID and produces SLTW. Deadly/Poisonous for stickman;
	FRON - Freon, cold gas;
	FOIL - Freon, but liquid. Also "refrigerator oil";
	MUR - Crazy element, a kind of crazy gas that explodes and melt anything;
	HYDR - Hydrogen, very flammable gas, produces water when mixed with oxygen;
	ROCK - Rock/Solid stone. It is like brick, but stronger;
	ALCH - Alcohol. Burns slowly Reduces stickman life;
	PLST - Plastic. Deforms but not disappear. (At first, I thought this one is hard to code but it is very, very easy.);
	PSTR - Plaster. A fragile white-ish solid. turns into DUST under pressure;
	MUD - Self-explanatory. Turns into GRND when heated;
	GRND - Ground. Solid, turns into MUD when mixed with water, into PGRN under pressure;
	PGRN - Powder ground. Turns into MUD when mixed with water;
	HEHC - Higly efficient heat conductor. (NOT instantaneous!) Undestructable;
	CORE - Singularity core. Reacts with almost anything causing a huge explosion. Best reacts with photons and neutrons;
	VIRU - A crazy virus. "Shine on your crazy diamond--Pink Floyd".

Mur's V1.4:
Fixed VIRU and other small things;
Fixed many bugs like Segmentation fault when MUR hits walls.

Mur's V1.5:

	SLPH - Sulphur/Sulfur. Mix with DSTW to create ACID;
	DYNA - Dynamite. Solid. Pressure explosive;
	TNT  - Trinitrotoluene. Very explosive powder. Mix with WATR to create DYNA;
	ALUM - Aluminium. Solid. Conducts electricity. Breaks under high pressure;
	BRAL - Aluminium in powder form. Mix with BRMT to create THRM;
	CFRE - Carbon film resistor;
	LEAD - Lead. Neutron absorber, slow conductor;
	UNWR - Unmeltable wire;
	STEL - Steel. Conducts electricity. Melts at very high temperature;
	POWV - VOID in powder form;
	COPY - Copy powder.
Added these GoL particles:
	PAT1 - Pattern 1 B1234567/S0123456;
	PAT2 - Pattern 2 B1234567/S0;
	FLAM - Flashing Maze B24/S1234;
	RULH - Rule H B2/S34;
	LFRD - Live Free or Die B0/S2;
	LIWD - Life Without Death B3/S012345678;
